My Personal/Portfolio site

## Purpose

The **intent** is to create a portfolio of sorts, not all inclusive but a place to illustrate my current/favorite projects in a variety of categories. It's also a place to tinker, learn and apply things to a longer running project.

While I hope others will find it a pleasurable experience, I don't want a cookie cutter site. I'm not as interested in a particular design methodology or being compatible with every browser. In many cases I will indeed be reinventing the wheel as I want to learn how/why things are like they are.

In the end, this is my site and how often do you build stuff where there isn't a deadline or client dictating how it progresses. So this may take a twist or turn, ignore well established approaches but there is no better time to try something weird!
